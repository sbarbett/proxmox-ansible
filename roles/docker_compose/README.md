# docker_compose

A role to deploy and manage Docker containers on Proxmox LXC hosts using Docker Compose. It configures and launches containers as defined in compose files, ensuring that Docker and its components are properly set up on the target host.

_Note:_ This role is intended to run on containers dynamically added to the `proxmox_containers_docker` inventory group as part of a larger workflow.
